# plt.c

C library for generating pseudo random numbers. Using the principles from
[pcg-random.org](https://pcg-random.org).

## Example usage

Seeding (requires two ints):

```c
rng_seed(time(NULL), 1);
```

Generating a random 32-bit integer:

```c
uint32_t roll = rng_u();
```

## Benchmark

Run the benchmark with:

```console
make benchmark
```

Results on M2 Macbook Pro:

```console
rng_u   1.015 ns/call
rand    6.626 ns/call
```
